Prism Pro brings smart automation to our customerâ€™s daily IT operations. The typical operations workflow is a continuous cycle of monitoring, analyzing and taking action where necessary. Prism Pro mirrors traditional IT Admin's workflows to improve operations efficiency. With Prism Pro, IT Admins are able to connect insights from machine data to automate this typical flow using the power of the machine learning engine X-FIT and the X-Play automation engine.

In this lab you will learn how Prism Pro can help IT Admins monitor, analyze and automatically act when a VM's memory resource is constrained.
